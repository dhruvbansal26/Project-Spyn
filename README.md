# Project Spyn - FSE 100 Master Project

## Introduction

The objective of Project Spyn is to design and develop an autonomous wheelchair that can safely and efficiently navigate a maze-like environment without human intervention. The wheelchair is equipped with a LEGO Mindstorm EV3 kit, which acts as its brain, and the navigation script is implemented using MATLAB.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation of a wheelchair using LEGO Mindstorm EV3 and MATLAB.
- Integration of color sensors and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and maze following.
- Safe and reliable transportation of a disabled person within a predefined maze.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- LEGO Mindstorm EV3 kit
- LEGO Mindstorm EV3 ultrasonic sensor
- LEGO Mindstorm EV3 color sensor
- Custom-built wheelchair with LEGO Mindstorm EV3 compatibility
